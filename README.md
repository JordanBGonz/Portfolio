# BookNest

I have created a website with a custom navigation bar that allows people to see a limited collection of books descriptions, authors, and reviews for each.

Above is a preview of the homepage to the website. I have several navigation tabs that take you to the pages to view books.
When you click "Our Books" at the top, it shows you a list of all the books with descriptions and the authors.
